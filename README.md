# Bodhi HPC User Guide

Documentation site for the Bodhi HPC cluster — SLURM usage, backups, and support contacts.

**Live site:** <https://rnabioco.github.io/bodhi-docs/>

## Local development

Requires [pixi](https://pixi.sh):

```bash
# Serve docs locally at http://localhost:8000
pixi run docs

# Build the site (strict mode)
pixi run build
```

## Converter script

A sed-based helper that converts common `#BSUB` directives and `$LSB_*` variables to SLURM equivalents:

```bash
bash scripts/lsf2slurm.sh myjob.lsf > myjob.slurm
```

See the [converter documentation](https://rnabioco.github.io/bodhi-docs/conversion-script/) for details on what it does and doesn't handle.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. The site is served from the `gh-pages` branch.

To enable: **Settings → Pages → Source → `gh-pages` branch**.
